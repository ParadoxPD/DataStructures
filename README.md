# Data Structures And Algorithms 

## Description :

Programs implementing Data Structures and algorithms
 
 -  Mostly written in **Java**(Maybe a bit C/C++)
 -  Contains most **data structures** and its implementation
 -  Also contains some **Algorithms** like sorting , searching and hashing , etc.
  
 ## Data Structures : 
  - [ ] Array
    - [ ] Static Array
    - [x] Dynamic Array 
  - [ ] Linked List
    - [ ] Singly linked List 
    - [x] Doubly linked List 
    - [ ] Circular linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Sparse Matrix

## Algorithms :
- [ ] **Sorting** 
  - [ ] Bubble Sort
  - [ ] Selection Sort
  - [ ] Insertion Sort
  - [ ] Merge Sort
  - [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] **Searching**
  - [ ] Linear Search
  - [ ] Binary Search
